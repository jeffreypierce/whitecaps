## Whitecaps

Whitecaps is an aleatoric, generative noise machine built with the web audio api.

It sculps sounds out of a set of user defined variables, creating filtered, panned noise (white, pink and brown) and low frequency hums (triangle waves). It is listenable on laptop and mobile speakers, but a much better experience is achieved with headphones.

While it works in most modern browsers (no IE), it is currently fairly processer intensive. You might hear some distortion if you add too many voices, especially on mobile devices.

Its home on the web is [whitecaps.io](http://whitecaps.io).
